Browsers have become an integral part of our life and most applications are web-based now. Web browsers are used for everything, from asking a question on Stackoverflow to booking a flight ticket.

We often end up having a huge number of tabs open and it becomes quite hard to keep a track of them. It gets especially confusing when we try to switch between tabs. Let us look at 5 keyboard shortcuts that can boost our productivity!

**Note**: Although I am going to be talking about keyboard shortcuts specific to Chrome, they should remain the same across all Chromium-based browsers (Brave, Edge, Vivaldi, etc.)

## Moving between tabs
Clicking tabs can be quite a painful and slow process, especially, if you switch between them frequently. Keyboard shortcuts greatly speed things up here.

`Ctrl` + `Tab` (for Windows) and `‚åò` + `‚å•` + `‚Üí` (for macOS) lets you move to the next tab.

Edit: `Ctrl` + `Tab` works on macOS too, kudos to @[Dhruva Srinivas](/author/dhruva) for pointing it out

Bonus: We can also move to the previous tab with `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `Tab` (for Windows and macOS) and `‚åò` + `‚å•` + `‚Üê` (for macOS).

## Re-opening closed tabs
We tend to close tabs by mistake but there is a simple keyboard shortcut that can re-open the last closed tab:

`Ctrl` + `Shift` + `T` (for Windows) and `‚åò` + `Shift` + `T` (for macOS) lets you re-open recently closed tabs in the order they were closed in.

Bonus: If you close a whole window, the above keyboard shortcut will re-open the whole window with all the tabs!

## Searching through open tabs
As the number of tabs open gets larger and larger, it gets difficult to find a tab. Fortunately, from Chrome version 87 onwards, we can search through all open tabs as well as recently closed tabs.

`Ctrl` + `Shift` + `A` (for Windows) and `‚åò` + `Shift` + `A` (for macOS) opens the tab search dialog.

## Close the current tab
After we are done with using a web page on a tab, it is a good idea to close it so that it doesn't clutter our tab bar and keeps the resource usage low.

`Ctrl` + `W` (for Windows) and `‚åò` + `W` (for macOS) closes the current tab.

Bonus: `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `W` (for Windows) and `‚åò` + `Shift` + `W` (for macOS) closes the current window.

## Open a new tab or a window
`Ctrl` + `T` (for Windows) and `‚åò` + `T` (for macOS) opens a new tab and jumps to it.

Similarly, `Ctrl` + `N` (for Windows) and `‚åò` + `N` (for macOS) opens a new window and jumps to it.
